	<h2> Dogs Have Better Noses</h2>
	<img src="images/photo-1.JPG">
	<p>Dog can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 	million times lower than humans can. The wet nose is essential 	for determining the direction of the air current containing 	the smell. Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the 	cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air 	currents.</p>

	<h2> Cats Have Better Tongues</h2>
	<img src="images/cat.png">
		<article>
			<p>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending 	many hours licking their coats. The cat's tongue has 	backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which are 	called papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain 	keratin. These spines allow cats to groom themselves by 	licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a 	hairbrush.</p>
